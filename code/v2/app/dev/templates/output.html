 	  <p>If you see <span1>RED</span1>, it means that your writing is less clear on this measure than most of the published articles. You most likely need to fix it.</p>
 	  <p>If you see <span2>YELLOW</span2>, it means that your writing is similar to the average published article. However, because academic text is difficult to read on average (Crosier 2004; Gazni 2011; Holbrook 1986; Loveland et al. 1973; Metoyer-Duran 1993; Parker, Teddlie, and Chan 1988; Sawyer, Laran, and Xu 2008), you should still take a close look at this aspect of your writing and try to improve it as much as you can.</p>
 	  <p>If you see <span3>GREEN</span3>, it means that your writing is clearer on this measure than most of the published articles. You do not need to focus on fixing this aspect of your writing, although it will not hurt to look for ways to further improve it. </p>

        <h3>Is your concreteness score low?</h3>
        <p>If your writing is not concrete, readers who are not already familiar with your research will struggle to understand your ideas. If you are not using enough examples (see your "Example" score), include more examples. If you are already including examples, make sure that your examples are made of concrete rather than quicksand. Click <a href="{{ url_for('static',filename='abstractions.html') }}" title="Link">here</a> for more advice on how to make your writing more concrete.</p>

        <h3>Is your example score low?</h3>
        <p>If your writing does not include examples, readers who are not already familiar with your research will struggle to understand your ideas. If your example score is low, you should probably add more examples. One exception to this is if your writing includes examples that you do not mark with one of the following phrases: "for example, "e.g." "as in," "for instance," "namely," or "such as." If some of your examples do not begin with those phrases, our bots cannot detect those examples. So if you include a lot of examples without using these markers, you might be okay, even if your score is low.

        <h3>Is your frequency score low?</h3>
        <p>If your writing uses too much technical language, readers who are not already familiar with your research will struggle to understand your ideas. If your word frequency score is low, and you want readers outside of your narrow subfield to understand your writing, try to replace jargon and technical phrases with more common language.

        <h3>Is your active voice score low?</h3>
        <p>If you use too much passive writing, readers will struggle to understand your ideas. Be sure to clearly identify the actors and the action in your sentences by (a) using active rather than passive voice, (b) avoiding ambiguous pronouns, and (c) replacing zombie nouns (nominalizations) with verbs.
